### Hi there 👋

I’m Colton, a computer science student and software engineer based in Maryland, U.S.A.

I build things, explore what I’m interested in, and enjoy turning ideas into code.

Lately, I’ve been having a lot of fun gamifying my learning through platforms like CodinGame and libraries such as Pygame.

My main tech stack is Python, JavaScript, HTML/CSS, and C++.  
I spend a lot of time working with Git, databases, Linux environments, and performance-focused web development.

I’ve worked on everything from personal websites and client projects to academic AI research and small game development.

I’m always learning — whether it’s a new feature, a current interest, or a side project.

- 🏴‍☠️ One Piece is my favorite anime
- 🤖 I’m involved in an artificial intelligence research group
- 🍝 Pasta is my favorite food
- 🎸 Hobbies: coding, guitar, and gaming
